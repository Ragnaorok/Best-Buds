## Prerequisites (For server hosting/testing)

In order to try this out you need the following software to be installed on your machine:

* Java (will automatically use the right java version for client-side) (e.g. [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/))
* Minecraft 
* [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.19.2.html)

## Quickstart

Clone the template project to your system: <br> ex:
````bash
git clone https://github.com/Ragnaorok/Best-Buds.git
````

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) for building. So on your command line run

````bash
sdk install gradle
```` 
note that you need atleast java 8 to run gradle <br>
To install your mod in another Minecraft server just copy the file `target/mc-plugin-template-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to
that server's `mods` folder. <br>
Example Output Below:

```
[19:33:52 INFO]: [Best-Buds] Enabling Best-Buds v1.0
``` 

Start the Mincraft client on your computer and connect to the local Mincraft server by specifying `localhost` as Server Address. <br>
Alternatively connect to the server using your public ipv4 if you have port forwarded the server


To play with the code e.g. import this mod in [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/). The
community edition is absolutely sufficient. Read [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) how to
